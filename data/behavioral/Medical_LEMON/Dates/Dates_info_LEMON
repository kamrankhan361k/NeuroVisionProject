LEMON Dates

The following file provides an overview of the dates of the datasets. 

If in any case the blood drawing was not possible on the assessment day 1, it was acquired on the following assessment days. The new date is mentioned in this data file. Sometimes the date of the blood drawing for direct analysis varies from the date of the remaining blood samples which were stored at -80° C for later use, thus mentioned accordingly.
