TMT
Trail Making Test – visual/spatial search & reaction change

Reference:
Reitan, R.M. (1992): Trail Making Test. Reitan Neuropsychology Laboratory

Aim:
Visual/spatial search & reaction change

Tasks (paper & pen version (DIN-A-4))
TMT_A: only numbers (1-25)
Participant has to connect numbers as fast as possible in an ascending order.

TMT_B: numbers and letters (1-13, A-L)
Participant has to connect numbers and letters in an alternating and ascending order as fast as possible.


Interpretation of score:
“Based in the extensive studies performed, the correct score ranges for adults suggested for correlations with brain functions are as follows (Reitan & Wolfs, 1988)”

Trails A:
Perfectly normal= 0-26 sec.;
Normal= 27-39 sec.;
Mild/Moderately Impaired= 40-51 sec.;
Moderately/Severely Impaired= 52 sec.+

Trails B:  
Perfectly normal= 0-65 sec.;
Normal= 66-85 sec.;
Mild/Moderately Impaired= 86-120 sec.;
Moderately/Severely Impaired= 121 sec.+

Coding brain functions:
Perfectly normal= 1
Normal= 2
Mild/Moderately Impaired= 3
Moderately/Severely Impaired= 4

Column names in the csv file:
TMT_1 = time it took to connect numbers (seconds. milliseconds)
TMT_2 = brain functions based on performance for Trail A (Reitan & Wolfson, 1988)
TMT_3 = how many errors did the pp. make
TMT_4 = comments
TMT_5 = time it took to connect numbers and letters (seconds. milliseconds)
TMT_6 = brain functions based on performance for Trail B (Reitan & Wolfson, 1988)
TMT_7 = how many errors did the pp. make
TMT_8 = comments
