Task description:
Participant has to press a button (as fast as possible) when a cross (visual stimuli) appears on screen.

Four rounds, each containing 20 stimuli (1. and 4. without audio signal; 2. and 3. with audio signal).

Before the beginning of the test a pretest was conducted.

Reaction times in ms


Column names in csv file:

TAP_A_1 = reaction time medians for 1. round (no signal)
TAP_A_2 = reaction time medians for 2. round (signal)
TAP_A_3 = reaction time medians for 3. round (signal)
TAP_A_4 = reaction time medians for 4. round (no signal)

NO signal (aggregate scores)
TAP_A_5 = mean reaction time (no signal)
TAP_A_6 = median reaction time (no signal)
TAP_A_7 = % (no signal)
TAP_A_8 = standard deviations (no signal)
TAP_A_9 = % (no signal)

Signal (aggregate scores)
TAP_A_10 = mean reaction time (signal)
TAP_A_11 = median reaction time (signal)
TAP_A_12 = % (signal)
