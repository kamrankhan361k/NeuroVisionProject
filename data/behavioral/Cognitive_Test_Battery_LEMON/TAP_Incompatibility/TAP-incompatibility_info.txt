TAP-incompatibility
Testbatterie zur Aufmerksamkeitsprüfung - interference tendency

Reference:
Zimmermann, P., Fimm, B. (2012): Testbatterie zur Aufmerksamkeitsprüfung Version 2.3.. Psychologische Testsysteme

Aim:
Tests the interference tendency by stimulus-reaction incompatibility (Simon-Effect)

Task description:
An arrow appears on the left or the right side of the screen (there is an audio signal before each stimulus).

Participant has to press, as fast as possible, the left or the right button according to the direction of the arrow (NOT according to side of appearance). The right button is in the right hand of the participant and the left one on the left hand of the participant.

Compatible and incompatible stimuli (each 30 stimuli).

Reaction times in ms.
