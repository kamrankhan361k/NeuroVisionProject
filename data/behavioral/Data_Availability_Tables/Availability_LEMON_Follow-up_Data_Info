Availability Table of LEMON Data
Follow-up experiments of LEMON participants
(also participating in Mendes et al 2017. )


In addition to the meta file, we include a data availability (.csv) file which includes all the LEMON data available for each specific data acquisition section with subscales (1=available, 0=not available).
